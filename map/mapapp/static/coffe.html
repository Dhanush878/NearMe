        <p>Good food, would be helpful if the service personnel understood the menu.<br>
            French Toast was ok, Waffles with icecream & Pancake with hazelnut spread was good.<br>
            Tricolour Flamnenkuchen was tasty.Bbq chicken sliders were great.<br>
            Croissants with Writers Hot Chocolate was yummy.Mac&Cheese was not that great.Affogato&Mocha Irish were just ok.</p>
